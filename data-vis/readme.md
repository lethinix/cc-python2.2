## assignment 6

for my assignment i found some EPA environmental data sets online. the two that i used are site.csv and ozone_2024.csv. 

site.csv has a list of sites that can be found in the different data sets. it contains information like site ID, number, name, agency that gathers the data, state, and other location information. it also contains elevation, which is what i pulled from it. 

ozone_2024.csv contains information on ozone levels at different sites in 2024. 

for my first graph, I explored the top ozone levels in 2024 for site ABT147.

for my second graph, i wanted to see the top ozone levels for all sites in the file, labled with the date to see if there was a correlation between time of year and ozone levels.

for my third graph, i looked at ozone levels and elevation. the graph shows the sites and dates with the top 20 highest ozone levels, and shows the elevation for those sites on the y axis. i didn't see a correlation here, but i think i'd also have to look at the sites' average ozone level in 2024, with the elevation of each site in order to get a better piture.
