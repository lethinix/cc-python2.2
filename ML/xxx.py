# wall_of_text = """ New York (CNN)When Liana Barrientos was 23 years old, she got married in Westchester County, New York.
# A year later, she got married again in Westchester County, but to a different man and without divorcing her first husband.
# Only 18 days after that marriage, she got hitched yet again. Then, Barrientos declared "I do" five more times, sometimes only within two weeks of each other.
# In 2010, she married once more, this time in the Bronx. In an application for a marriage license, she stated it was her "first and only" marriage.
# Barrientos, now 39, is facing two criminal counts of "offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree," referring to her false statements on the
# 2010 marriage license application, according to court documents.
