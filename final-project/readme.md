##Final project proposal

For my final project i'm torn between two options. 

Option one: 
for my major studio project, i'm working on a dystopian chatroom that censors users' messages. as of right now, it uses a list of words and replacements on google sheets that's reachable to my code by the google cloud api. as of right now the concept is that the chatroom lets the users practice communicating through censorship in a mad libs puzzle kind of way. but it would be interesting to make a version that uses an ai model trainined on dystopian books that acts as the moderation system instead, so when the users send a message, their message gets moderated to fit into the dystopian world it exists in. 

Option two: 
My background is in envrionmental engineering, so for my portfolio i started working on a compuational design project that analyzes turbine measurement and output data in rhino and i want to continue it in grasshopper. The second idea is to incorporate machine learning here by using a model to reccomend a wind turbine based on site characteristics, location,and climate. I have no idea how i would do this though, or how to train a model for this project.
