### data scraping assignment 

for this assignment, i was trying to scrape wind turbine data to use for another project. i first looked at USGS (united states geological survey) to find some wind turbine data --they had a lot, but it's already publically available for free and downloadable as a csv. i still tried to scrape the data but since it wasn't in a scrapable format i couldn't get what i was looking for.

then on reddit i found this site that has different data about the world, so i tried to scrape that for environmental data. i couldn't figure out how to pull the actual environmental data, so i pulled some headings related to the environment.
